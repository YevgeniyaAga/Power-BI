ðŸ§³ LEGO Set Explorer | Power BI Interactive Dashboard

ðŸŽ‰ About the Project

This project simulates the experience of an avid LEGO collector exploring over 4,000 LEGO sets to find the perfect next set. Built as part of an advanced Power BI crash course led by Maven Analytics Founder Chris Dutton, the dashboard is designed to be highly interactive and visually polished.
