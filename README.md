ðŸ§³ LEGO Set Explorer | Power BI Interactive Dashboard

ðŸŽ‰ About The Project

This project simulates the experience of an avid LEGO collector exploring over 4,000 LEGO sets to find the perfect next set. It was built as part of an advanced Power BI crash course led by Maven Analytics Founder Chris Dutton.

The goal was to design an interactive and visually polished dashboard that allows users to explore LEGO sets dynamically, using filters such as theme, piece count, age range, and price.

ðŸ“Š Key Features

Interactive Exploration: Filter LEGO sets by theme, age range, price, and number of pieces.

Custom Image Tooltips: Hover over a LEGO set name to view a thumbnail image of the box art.

Decomposition Tree: Drill down into total pieces by theme, age range, and year.

Numeric Range Parameters: Allow dynamic selection of piece count or price ranges.

Bookmark Actions: Implement a "Reset Filters" button for user-friendly navigation.

Page Navigation: Seamlessly navigate between exploration pages and set details pages.

Professional UI/UX: Clean layout with rounded corners, shadows, and smooth slicer experiences.

ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes

Advanced visual formatting in Power BI (cards, tooltips, buttons)
